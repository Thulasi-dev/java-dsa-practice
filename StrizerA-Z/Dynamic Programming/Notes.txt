✅ What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a technique to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems, 
solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant work.

In simpler words:

Solve small parts first
Remember the results (usually in an array, hashmap, or variable)
Use these results to build the solution for bigger parts

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique where we solve a problem by breaking it into smaller overlapping
subproblems, storing their results, and building the final solution from these stored results
