/*Find GCD of two numbers

Problem Statement: Given two integers N1 and N2, find their greatest common divisor.

Example 1:
Input: N1 = 9, N2 = 12

Output: 3
Explanation:
Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Common Factors: 1, 3
Greatest common factor: 3 (GCD)

Example 2:
Input: N1 = 20, N2 = 15

Output: 5
Explanation:
Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
Common Factors: 1, 5
Greatest common factor: 5 (GCD)

/* Time Complexity: O(min(N1, N2)) where N1 and N2 is the input number.
  The algorithm iterates from the minimum of N1 and N2 to 1 and each iteration checks
   whether both the numbers are divisible by the current number (constant time operations).
   Space Complexity: O(1) */
